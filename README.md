# HeadGlitch Software

![Profile Picture](./BrandKit/render/banners/HeadGlitch-Github-Banner(Dark).png)

Hey there! I'm a **self-taught programmer** and **graphic designer** with a passion for creating visually driven, open-source applications. My focus is on **front-end application design**, and I love blending creativity with code to build everything from games to novelty software and unique user interfaces.  

HeadGlitch is my personal brand and creative playground, where I experiment with innovative ideas. Whether I'm crafting interactive designs, building compelling games, or exploring new ways to engage through software, I’m always looking to push boundaries.  

I’m always open to collaborating on cool projects, getting feedback to improve, or connecting with like-minded creators. Feel free to reach out, and let’s create something awesome together!
